# School_website
Create a school website with a number of different functionalities

This is a personal project to try to consolidate a number of techniques I have learned as well as expand upon my range of skills.

**Core functionality**
- School splash page
- Login section with user verification
- Database of both students and teachers
- Area for teachers to enter grades for students
- Some type of display features on the main page

**Additional functionality**
- Features on the main page such as API calls for weather, local news in the area, etc.
- Ability for teachers to create reports for student grades, to move students from one class to another etc
- Ability for teachers to send messages to students
- Host on Heroku or similar

**Languages**
- Initially I intend to build the front end with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS for functionality
- Backend will mainly be PHP for database interaction; Laravel to create chat functionality (later)
- Node.js will be used to make API calls for the main page/alternatively JS APIs will be used for promises/fetch requests
- Running on XAMPP server with PHPAdmin and MySQL

**Learning outcomes**
- Using Udemy courses on PHP and Laravel to boost back end knowledge
- Create a functional website with a back end, database, and API integration
